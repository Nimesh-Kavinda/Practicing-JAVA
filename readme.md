# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice work on core Java concepts, aimed at building a strong foundation in Java programming. I use **IntelliJ IDEA** as my primary development environment for this project.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, operators, and control statements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, sets, maps, and iterators.
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and exception hierarchy.
- **Multithreading**: Threads, synchronization, and concurrency utilities.
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing files, serialization, and streams.
- **Java 8+ Features**: Lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces.

## Tools and Technologies

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit 17 (or specify your version)
